		<h2>How we design</h2>
		<p>Our goal is to help you do your best work. To this end, each designer controls the full cycle of their design, starting from basic information architecture and userflows and working all the way down to pixel tuning. Some even manage client relationships.</p>
		<p>If you come from a larger company, this extent of ownership might seem odd — maybe a bit scary. Not at O/M. Our team is tight-knit and we always find a way to have each other’s back, whether during design reviews, open crit hours, or Friday show and tells.</p>

		<h2>Life at the studio</h2>
		<p>Being in the Mission, food outings are a stable of the studio. In between bites of tacos, we also go on field trips to print shops, design meetups, workshops, and more! During the rare down times, we work on a fresh produce <a href="http://howfresh.co/" target="_blank">catalogue</a> for Northern California. Yes, it is possible that we like food too much. </p>
